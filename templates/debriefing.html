                    <p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
                    important contribution to our understanding of human learning and decision making. </p>

                    <p>
                        Information collection and integration are fundamental to making successful actions.
                        Previous research has focused on how people combine information they have been given into cohesive decisions.
                        However, in the real world, are not only given information, such as at school, but also seek out and collect their own information, such as when someone peeks over a fence or looks something up on a website.
                        This study helps us understand the process people make in not only combining information into decisions such as where to drill, but also in deciding how humans collect information in the first place (e.g. where you decided to sample in this game).
                        This research will help us develop a better understanding of how people collect information and make decisions (including what to collect and learn from next) in the real world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
                        principal investigator, Jon Berliner, at <a href="mailto:jsb4@princeton.edu">jsb4@princeton.edu</a>

                <p>I feel that I have been adequately debriefed about the nature
                    of the study.  The investigator has explained the purposes of the
                    research to me, and I feel that any questions I have asked were
                    satisfactorily answered.</p>
